## What is 3D graphics rendering?  

3D rendering is the 3D computer graphics process of converting 3D models into 2D images on a computer. 
The process of rendering 3D graphics usually involves 3D modeling (lightning and texturing), the rendering itself and refining.
It has huge application in game development, as 3D-games depends on it, and all based on linear algebra fundamentals.
